An Automated Medical Report Summarizer is a system designed to extract and summarize key medical information from
patient reports (e.g., lab results, discharge summaries, prescriptions, etc.), helping medical staff quickly understand a
patientâ€™s condition without reading lengthy documents.
Key Features:

File Upload: Upload medical PDFs, Word docs, or plain text files.

Text Extraction: Extract raw text from the uploaded file (using tools like PyMuPDF, pdfplumber, or textract).

Summarization: Apply extractive or abstractive summarization (via NLP models like BERT, T5, or GPT).

Save to Database: Store original and summarized reports for retrieval and comparison.
